What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new repository is created for the user. The user needs to keep a track of all the changes made to file/file(s) so that they can 
revert back to an older version if the newer version is not working upto the mark. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a buffer. It is a place where the files can be temporarily moved before being committed. 
It allows the user to to place multiple files in one place before committing all of it as a single commit.
