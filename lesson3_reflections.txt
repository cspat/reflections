When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Group projects involving teams spanning different geographical locations. 
Making your code public. 
The user would want to make their repository remote instead of keeping it local in the above 2 cases. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Let us consider the case of 2 users, user1 and user2. user1 is working on projectA where as user2 is working on projectB. 
user1 might only want to pull changes  made to projectA and not projectB. The same applies to user2 as well who might only want to deal with projectB. 
Hence, it helps to have to pull changes manually rather than having Git pull them automatically for the user. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: Similar to a clone, but only on Github
Clone: A copy of the existing repository. Available on local host as well as Github. 
Branches: A master branch may have 1 or more branches. Usually done to try [like adding a new feature] something new with existing code without having any adverse effects on it.
